## 📋 Project Overview

This report was built for the **Power BI Dataviz World Championships – Barcelona Round 1**, analysing five years (2021–2025) of sales, traffic, and customer data for **PitchSide Pro** — a fictional football merchandise retailer operating across three regions (Americas, APAC, EMEA) and two channels (Mobile App, Web).

The goal was not just to visualise data, but to tell a complete business story — from high-level performance through to ranked, actionable strategic priorities.

### DAX Highlights

**Dynamic Top Driver Detection**
```dax
Top Region Name = 
CALCULATE(
    SELECTEDVALUE(Dim_Region[MacroRegion]),
    TOPN(
        1,
        VALUES(Dim_Region[MacroRegion]),
        CALCULATE([Net Revenue], 'Date'[Year] = MAX('Date'[Year])) - 
        CALCULATE([Net Revenue], 'Date'[Year] = MAX('Date'[Year]) - 1)
    )
)
```

**Custom SVG Sparkline Cards**
```dax
-- Dynamic min/max normalisation for sparkline rendering
VAR MonthsTable = 
    CALCULATETABLE(
        ADDCOLUMNS(VALUES('Date'[MonthNumber]), "@Value", [Net Revenue]),
        'Date'[Year] = 2025
    )
VAR MinVal = MINX(MonthsTable, [@Value])
VAR MaxVal = MAXX(MonthsTable, [@Value])
VAR Range = MaxVal - MinVal
```

**Dynamic Key Watch Alert**
```dax
Key Risk Country = 
CALCULATE(
    SELECTEDVALUE(Dim_Region[Country]),
    TOPN(1, VALUES(Dim_Region[Country]),
        CALCULATE([Net Revenue YoY %], 'Date'[Year] = MAX('Date'[Year])), ASC
    )
)
```

**League Launch Lift %**
```dax
League Launch Lift % = 
VAR LaunchDays    = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Date'), 'Date'[IsLeagueLaunch] = 1)
VAR NonLaunchDays = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Date'), 'Date'[IsLeagueLaunch] = 0)
VAR LaunchPerDay    = DIVIDE([League Launch Revenue], LaunchDays)
VAR NonLaunchPerDay = DIVIDE([Non-Launch Revenue], NonLaunchDays)
RETURN DIVIDE(LaunchPerDay - NonLaunchPerDay, NonLaunchPerDay)
```

### Design System
